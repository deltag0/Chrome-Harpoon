## Overview

**Chrome Harpoon** is a productivity-focused Chrome extension that helps you stay in flow by letting you quickly mark and jump to frequently used tabs with custom keybindings.

If you sometimes struggle to find which tab you wanted to switch back to from your tens or even hundreds of tabs, this extension is for you!
