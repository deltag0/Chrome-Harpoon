## Overview

**Chrome Harpoon** is a productivity-focused Chrome extension that helps you stay in flow by letting you quickly mark and jump to frequently used tabs with custom keybindings. Inspired by tools like Vim's Harpoon and Vimium, itâ€™s designed for developers and power users who want faster tab navigation without reaching for the mouse.

## Features

- Mark tabs for quick access with a single shortcut
- Jump to any marked tab instantly
- Visual tab selector
- Persistent tab state across sessions
- Lightweight and keyboard-friendly

## Installation

Install directly from the Chrome Web Store:

## Usage
| Shortcut     | Action                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Alt + A`   | **Mark/Pin the current tab**                                           |
| `Alt + 0â€“9` | **Switch to a marked tab** (1 is the first marked tab, 0 is the last) |
| `Alt + Z`   | **Go back to the previously selected tab**                            |
| `Alt + Y`   | **Undo a tab switch** (similar to `Ctrl + Y` in text editors)         |
