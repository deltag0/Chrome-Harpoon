## Overview

**Chrome Harpoon** is a productivity-focused Chrome extension that helps you stay in flow by letting you quickly mark and jump to frequently used tabs with custom keybindings. Inspired by tools like NeoVims's Harpoon (https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon), it‚Äôs designed for anyone who wants faster tab navigation without reaching for the mouse  
If you sometimes struggle to find which tab you wanted to switch back to from your tens or even hundreds of tabs, this extension is for you!

## Features

‚öì Pin Tabs ‚Äì Use Alt + A to pin your current tab.

üî¢ Quick Access ‚Äì Jump to a pinned tab with Alt + 1 through Alt + 9, and Alt + 0 for the 10th.

üîÑ Toggle Tabs ‚Äì Use Alt + Z to switch back to the previously selected tab.

‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo Switches ‚Äì Use Alt + Y to undo a tab switch.

## Differences between traditional marks
* Jump back to exactly where you left the page
* Add marked tabs to a list
* Reorder tabs at any time or delete them (marks are not re-ordered after deletion)
